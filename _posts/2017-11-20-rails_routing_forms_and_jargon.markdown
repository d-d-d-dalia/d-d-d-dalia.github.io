Following the path in the MVC has become increasingly fun as I've been working with rails. It's a lot to keep in your head, and as usual, I find the hardest part is the jargon. Trying to 1) find what you're looking for online as far as resources goes, 2) explain to someone what you are trying to do, 3) explain to someone what you don't understand - it's all challenging, and all requires precise language. It's been the biggest deterrent for me. I find myself wanting and needing to say it outloud to someone else, to map it verbally, in order to solidify the functional concept - where do I want this button to lead, and what do I want the page to do/say when it gets there?

Right now, terms I'm struggling to articulate the meaning of include nested routes, and nested forms. I think I know what their purposes are, but I can't explain how they appear syntactically or what is happening word for word on the page. In the next week, as my project takes full form, I'm sure it will come into focus.

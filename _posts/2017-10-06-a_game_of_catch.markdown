At the very beginning of my code experience, during object orientation, I started to feel like what was going on was real life - objects moving around doing things to other objects. I wondered if it would be helpful to create lessons as if they were pieces of theatre, with real humans playing the role of objects, executing actions and handing data (things) to other people, or putting them in other places. Later, talking to a learn coach, someone described everything as a game of catch. It really is a simple concept, but without it, it's very difficult to move your understanding foward. I always found myself asking "what information do we have?", "what are we *allowed* to do here?" "where is the information going and what affect is it having on what?"

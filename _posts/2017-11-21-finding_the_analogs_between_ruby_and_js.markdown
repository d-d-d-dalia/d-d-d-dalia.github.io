I had learned some basic JS before starting FI, and the idea of functions was cool with me. Coming back to it after months of Ruby has been an adjustment. Object Orientation seems to have taken over my brain! In these beginning days, I'm trying to focus on articulating the meaning of all of the syntax, and just getting used to reading JS. As usual, thinking out loud is key. Using the proper terms, and identifying what their analogs would be in Ruby is also really helpful. 

Some things I haven't identified are whether the map and filter functions have direct analogs in Ruby. I intend to answer those questions maybe today or in the coming days as I make my way through the first sections.

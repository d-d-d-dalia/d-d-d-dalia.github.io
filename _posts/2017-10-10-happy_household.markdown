This project made a world of difference in understanding forms, and routing. It built really well upon the fwitter experience.

In addition, it got me really thinking about the user's experience. Where do I need buttons, and what flash messages to post on which pages, so that navigation made sense. I began to notice how I was flexing new muscles -- seeing a need in the browser and trying to find where in the code it needed to appear.

The app also got me thinking about every-day problems worth solving, hence this very practical app for logging chores that everyone in the house can see.

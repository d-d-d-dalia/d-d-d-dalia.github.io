I've been on Learn now for almost 3 months. I'm 38% complete and only just now submitting my first CLI project. I feel like I've learned so much in terms of starting to gain a foundation in code language. I remember when the IDE was totally mystifying, and I didn't know the terminal from the text editor. Navigation in the directory was voodoo.

Object orientation is still a huge challenge. Connecting the dots is a constant struggle and ongoing exercise. My most common questions are "How does the computer know ?" and "Where did the computer get that information?" and "What said what to what and what did it say?". 

I've learned that it is all about following the path through the execution of the program and to always remember that nothing is magic. Ruby so far feels like a physical environment. I've begun to imagine actual people passing things around and carrying out specific actions on those things as a way of piecing the way the program works together. I've been thinking that it might be cool to create some actual theatrical skits to act out the basics of object orientation, or simulate the concepts of objects and methods.

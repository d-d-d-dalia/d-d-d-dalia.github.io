There have been so many adjustments on this code school journey. Object orientation, the MVC structure, doing away with hard refreshes, and now changing state instead of navigating to new routes. Post object orientation, it has all felt like it was about getting data from point a to point b, and gradually more efficiently. Along the way, we have continually swapped out one term for another, though each seem to be like the last in meaning.

Here in React-Redux, the notion of 'props' are quite similar to 'attributes' in HTML. A 'component' really is just a 'div'. 'Elements' are well, 'elements'. 'Actions' can be thought of as pieces of 'reducers' and 'reducers' are basically the 'methods' of the React-Redux context. Redux is essentially an alternative to the MVC model.
